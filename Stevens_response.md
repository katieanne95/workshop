##### In the reading today (Stevens et al.) the authors use a technique to produce a high resolution description of the distribution of human populations across the globe. What is the name of the technique and describe in general and basic terms how it works?

This technique is called the "Random Forest" estimation technique.  It comnbines large scale global data sets with a weighting scheme based on a nonparametric predictive model. This means that linking different covariates with different weights, the model can predict factors like population density with a considerable amount of accuracy. 

##### The random forest method used by the authors is a machine learning algorithm (ensemble method). In general terms, what is a machine learning algorithm? Within the context of this study what distinguishes a data science, machine learning method (such as random forest) from previous classical statistical approaches to describing and analyzing phenomenon and events? #####

A machine learning algorithm creates an algorithm with the data it receives and uses this algorithm to draw further conclusions. This differes from classical statistical approaches because the classical models must constantly be reevaluated and updated as new conclusions are made, but the machine learning models can adapt and "learn" with the data.

##### In the reading, the authors use a number of geospatial covariates as predictors in their machine learning method. What were these geospatial covariates and approximately how big of a data set did they represent (in general terms)? What is the significance of big data in the estimation of machine learning methods for inferring the correlates and drivers of human population distributions? #####

They used a wide range of covariates, including things like land cover, lights at night, distance to things likes roads or rivers, and institutions like hospitals, schools, and railways that would indicate where more people would live. These were drawn from very large data sets for Cambodia, Vietnam, and Kenya. Big data like these are key to machine learning because these new methods can make use of such large quantities of data, but also the greater the data supplied is, the more specific and accurate the conclusions can be.

##### The authorsâ€™ results present a remarkable improvement over previous geospatial descriptions at very high resolution, of the distribution of the human population. Within the context of human development in LMICs, what is the significance of having a highly accurate description of where each person is located across planet earth? #####

By knowing where people are located, government can identify places that may need more solid infrastructures or more money in aid. Specifically, a more populous area may need a higher number of schools or clinics, but a more spread out area would need more school buses or ambulances to get people to the schools or clinics that may not be as close to them.

##### Within the context of human development in LMICs, what is the relevance to your area of investigation in having a highly accurate description of where each household and person is located across planet earth? #####

My area of investigation could be aided by accurate population mapping because it would identify places in immediate need of healthcare facilties or doctors and nurses in general. Similarly, it could identify how government aid would provide necessary help to those unable to afford maternal health services like cesarean sections or provide transportation to who live too far away from a facility to feasibly get them there in time.
