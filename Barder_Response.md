###Question 7: What was the Ajaokuta Steel Works? How did it illustrate the transition from a focus on policies to institutions?###

The Ajaokuta Steel Works is a steel production facility in Nigeria that was one of the most heavily invested in steel facilties ever, but it does not produce any steel due to faulty management. The facility shows that from a policy standpoint, Nigeria technically has a steel facility that technically has a lot of money invested in it, but the underlying corruption makes it impossible for any productive activities there. This exemplified the shift to focusing on institutions because the Ajaokuta Steel Works embodies the idea that it doesn't matter whether or not a policy has been put in place to install institutions if they aren't operating successfully. By supporting the institutions to make sure they are functional and successful for the society, be it corruption within a steel facility or corruption within the government as a whole, development can better be advanced.
