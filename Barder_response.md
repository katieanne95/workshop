#### Question 7: What was the Ajaokuta Steel Works? How did it illustrate the transition from a focus on policies to institutions? ####

The Ajaokuta Steel Works is a steel production facility in Nigeria that was one of the most heavily invested in steel facilties ever, but it does not produce any steel due to faulty management. The facility shows that from a policy standpoint, Nigeria technically has a steel facility that technically has a lot of money invested in it, but the underlying corruption makes it impossible for any productive activities there. This exemplified the shift to focusing on institutions because the Ajaokuta Steel Works embodies the idea that it doesn't matter whether or not a policy has been put in place to install institutions if they aren't operating successfully. By supporting the institutions to make sure they are functional and successful for the society, be it corruption within a steel facility or corruption within the government as a whole, development can better be advanced. 

#### Question 1: How does Owen Barder define development? How does he extend Amartya Sen's definition to include the idea of complexity? ####

Owen Barder defines development similarly to Amartya Sen in that he agrees that solely judging development on income is a rather incomplete measure. The two agree that a developed society would provide opportunities for people to exercise their rights and freedoms, specifically their ability to choose. However, Barder argues that  considering either the social or economic element of development without the other is just as incomplete. In his view, human development is a consequence of the interaction of social and economic systems and should be regarded as such, leading to more complexity in the definition.
