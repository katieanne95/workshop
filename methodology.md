Worldwide, 99% of maternal deaths occur in low- and middle- income countries. The right to safely deliver a child is practically a guarantee in higher income countries, but in a region like sub-Saharan Africa where maternal mortality rates are the highest in the world (some have been as much as a 1 in 50 chance of death in the past twenty years), mothers are often risking their lives by bringing a new life into the world (8, 2). Significant progress has been made in the past twenty years towards lowering these high rates of maternal death, with countries like Sierra Leone seeing their amount of maternal deaths nearly halved (3). However, even with such dramatic progress, the World Health Organization identifies in Figure 1 that the rates of death in regions like Sub-Saharan Africa are still nearly a hundred times as high as they are in developed countries.

The surface level issues seem to be solved. For instance, healthcare facilities are abundant in countries with high maternal mortality rates like Sierra Leone (7). Many countries like South Africa have enacted legislation to prevent the emigration of doctors from places that need it the most (4). If we are doing everything right, then why has the decrease in maternal mortality significantly slowed in the last five years, leaving countries with still shockingly high numbers (3)?

This is where more comprehensive data methods come into play. It is likely that the existing facilities are still insufficient to prevent mothers from dying from ailments like hemorrhages that could be properly addressed with the right medical care (5). Even with proper facilities, many mothers are unable to afford hospital care or transportation to a healthcare facility (8). Bosco et al. utilize artificial neural networks as a machine learning method in order to map certain countries by female literacy and the usage of contraceptive methods (1). I propose expanding on their research by also mapping Sub-Saharan Africa by income and by distance to a hospital. This should be done for the entirety of the region if possible, but the target priority countries should be where the rates are highest: South Sudan, Chad, and Sierra Leone. This machine learning model can be supported by a Bayesian population growth model for each unit to identify how the numbers of distribution may change over time (6). Essential to the success of this research, though, is the execution of a micro census in the target countries to identify and evaluate flaws that are preventing progress in these areas.

Artificial neural networks work through a web of interconnected nodes called “neurons.” The signals sent to each node (j) is represented by the equation

where “Wij is the connection weight, xi is the input to the network and bj is the bias term.” The signal is then plugged into the function for the artificial neural network, which is

where the range of sj can vary but the range of y is restricted to values between 0 and 1. An artificial neural network is a good choice for this research because they encompass both linear and nonlinear patterns. This is because an artificial neural network is designed to have the ability to learn in a way that is very similar to our brains. Bosco et al. explain that the artificial neural network outperforms other models especially in cases where the distribution of the data does not reflect a normal distribution. However, the networks still perform best where there already are strong correlations, such as between “literacy and urbanization.” I would like to utilize an artificial neural network to predict certain population attributes, namely income and the distance to a hospital. This is because I hypothesize that there is a correlation between income and maternal mortality rates and a correlation between income and the distance to a hospital. I question whether those correlations may have something to do with why maternal mortality rates are so high in Africa. If so, it is feasible that low income would be reflected by poorly maintained hospitals, contributing to more deaths (1).

To support the artificial neural network method, a Bayesian population growth model could be included. Using data from traditional population counting methods like censuses, Linard et al. describe how population growth is estimated using a simple equation for each gridcell. The equation is modeled as

![pert](https://github.com/katieanne95/workshop/blob/master/pert.png)

where P2010 indicates the projected population in 2010 within a pixel (since this information came from before 2010), “Pd is the population within the same pixel at the year of the input population data, t is the number of years between the input data and 2010, and r is the urban or rural average growth rate taken from the UN World Urbanization Prospects Database, 2007 version” (6). This equation differs from machine learning models like an artificial neural network in that it is far less complex and will not “learn” from the data it receives. However, this can be crucial in identifying how a population will change over time. Instead of 2010, the population could be predicted for each year between now and 2030 to identify how the population will change and grow over time, and to better understand how aid will need to be directed as time passes. Similarly, areas with quickly growing populations will evidently be areas with high amounts of births, so these areas could be better targeted as areas where further research methods including micro censuses could be directed to better interpret the effectiveness of any intergovernmental aid. 

Key to the success of the incorporation of these methods is a yearly micro census survey to evaluate the success of enacting changes. If the healthcare systems are truly inadequately meeting the needs of their constituents, a micro census directed at healthcare workers in maternal wards, mothers who are either expectant or had recently given birth, and the families of those mothers who were met with unfavorable outcomes would be able to quantify the specific inadequacies, allowing for more specific solutions. If the answer is that institutions are present but are not actually functioning in a way that meets the needs of the people, this discovery could be revolutionary in identifying areas that need to be addressed in the localities where mortality rates for mothers are at shocking highs.
