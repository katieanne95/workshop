##### Nieves et a. use the random forest machine learning method to predict what value globally? #####

Nieves et al. use the random forest machine learning method to predict population density globally.

##### Describe in detail how random forest works. #####

Random forest is an "ensemble" method that starts by determining which covariates are statistically significant and effective in predicting results accurately. Then, the algorithm creates decision trees using these covariates and combines a bunch of trees that are considered 'weak learners' into a 'strong learner' that can accurately predict factors like population density but also adapt to its findings to become even more accurate.

##### What is a dasymmetric population allocation? #####

Dasymetric population allocation is when census-based administrative units are redistributed into representative population grid cells. This is done using the population density weighting established through the random forest model.  

##### Which geospatial covariates proved to be the most important when predicting global values of where humans reside? #####

Nieves et al. found that the most important covariates were those that pertained to urban areas and topographical features. Specifically, the most important five covariate classes in order were urban/suburban extents, built environment and urban/suburban proxies, climatic/environmental variables, populated place covariates, and transportation networks.
