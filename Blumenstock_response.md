In his *Nature* article, Joshua Blumenstock opens by describing the glowing potential of data science for human development. He elaborates on how increasingly available data can help researchers plan and better society, such as through disaster relief and poverty assistance plans. These initiatives utilize global imaging to determine where aid is needed the most. As good as this sounds, though, the technology is not perfect just yet: Blumenstock entertains the idea that big data has the tendency to bring about biases and unexpected results, such as overrepresenting people who are already empowered because they have increased access to smartphones and other digital means of communication. Similarly, when in the wrong hands, data collection can be used against people; for example, in semi-authoritarian China the social credit score system continually disadvantages people who are already disadvantaged. On top of all these concerns, the greatest issue with big data at this point in time is the imperfections of technology. Though a computer can accomplish tasks quicker and on a broader scale, it can be easy for people to trick the system. Many data collection systems are in the hands of private companies or individuals and cannot be regulated as well as traditional government data collection methods like surveys and censuses, so they are much more difficult to validate and far easier to be manipulated by people who may want to reap the benefits of the poverty assistance programs though they are not truly in need of them. Though the producers of the technology may have done so with good intentions, these imperfect systems are no match for many conniving citizens that work solely on selfish intent. The necessary fixes for these problems lie in bringing back many traditional systems to incorporate them into the big data collection methods. In order to increase transparency and trust by presenting data proving the digital data collection systems are collecting accurate data, they should be backed by surveys and censuses. The best way to accomplish this goal is by encouraging cooperation between the private operators of thsee systems and the public sector. If these two join forces, perhaps data collection could be done more broadly and efficiently with less room for error. The traditional validation system should not be done away with until the digital data collection services can be better customized to look not just at necessity, but also to evaluate the effectiveness of certain programs or whether or not a program, like a loan offered to people who were determined to need it, was actually beneficial for the citizens or gave them more problems than they had to begin with. It is much harder for a computer to interpret those effects with today's technology.
