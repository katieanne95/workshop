**Introduction**

The purpose of this research is to improve upon the existing maternal care systems in place in Sub-Saharan Africa by generating a machine learning model to map maternal care facilities alongside where women of childbearing age (15-49) are likely to be at any given year. Many maternal deaths are caused by ailments like hemorrhages that could be easily addressed with the intervention of a skilled healthcare professional. However, healthcare facilities in Sub-Saharan Africa are often sparsely distributed and hospitals may not be accessible to all mothers, at least according to current limited studies mapping where women of childbearing age are densely populated in two African countries. Identifying areas that need assistance will help better direct aid from governments and/or intergovernmental organizations towards decreasing maternal mortality rates. I will achieve this goal through meeting the following objectives. (7, 8, 10)

1. Collect population data from national censuses or similar datasets to calculate the amount of women of childbearing age each year for each location gridcell. 
2. Strengthen the census data by creating a model to identify and account for factors that may encourage migration within Africa and use it to reach more accurate predictions.
3. Project this information on ten different maps for each of the next ten years identifying locations that should receive the most aid based on disparities between where healthcare facilities are located and where mothers are located.
4. Administer a survey each year of healthcare facilities and local population bureaus to calculate a yearly maternal mortality rate for target countries (Sierra Leone, South Sudan, Chad).
5. Administer a survey each year of mothers who gave birth within the year assessing their satisfaction with medical care they may have needed, perhaps asking how it has improved since their last child if they are not a first time mother.

This work will build on previous research by using the previously generated maps of healthcare facilities to identify the places where mothers experience the highest risk of death due to lack of access to healthcare because of distance, overwhelmed hospitals due to a small number compared to population density, or other similar issues.(juran) It also expands prior research that mapped neonatal and children under five mortality rates in Sub-Saharan Africa, and this is important because many causes of infant death could be maintained by less skilled workers, but doctors and nurses are truly necessary to prevent mothers from dying unnecessarily in dire circumstances. (5, 1)

**Human Development Topic**

Worldwide, 99% of maternal deaths occur in low- and middle- income countries. The right to safely deliver a child is practically a guarantee in higher income countries, but in a region like sub-Saharan Africa where maternal mortality rates are the highest in the world (some have been as much as a 1 in 50 chance of death in the past twenty years), mothers are often risking their lives by bringing a new life into the world. Many lives are lost because sub-Saharan Africa lacks the necessary healthcare facilities and skilled professionals in multiple countries throughout the region. Even in areas with doctors, though, many women are still unable to receive care due inability to find timely transportation to hospitals and afford care once they are there, especially if a cesarean section is required for safe delivery (9, 3, 6).

Amartya Sen describes human development as an expansion of freedom. In order to enjoy freedoms, one’s essential needs must first be met, the simplest of which is the right to live. A woman’s ability to choose to have children without a fear of probable death is one of the most basic ways freedoms can be expanded as development is furthered. Without childbirth, society simply cannot go on. This fact alone is reason enough that the safety of mothers should be taken into the utmost consideration, and the issue of maternal mortality should be one of the first concerns addressed when assisting with human development of a given region.The primary SDG (Sustainable Development Goal, as described by the United Nations) that relates to the issue of maternal mortality is Goal Number 3: Good Health and Well-Being. This is because preventing mothers from dying is the first and most crucial step towards promoting health and general well-being in their lives. On an extended scale, improving maternal healthcare facilities from being at the minimum necessary level for preventing death to being comfortable, clean, and efficient will further a mother’s overall well-being, as well as those close to her. Providing a future mother with assurance that her needs will be met safely, quickly, and in a way that is accessible to her (i.e. not too costly) will help ease the anxiety she may have surrounding entering this new stage of life, as well as easing the nerves of those close to her, such as her family or the father of the child. Maternal mortality rates are fortunately on the decline, but oftentimes mothers face other issues like long wait times for surgery, especially in times of pandemic like with the Ebola outbreak in 2014, and high costs of care. Only two-thirds of women in Ghana are estimated to have health insurance, and the anxiety about paying for a cesarean section while uninsured can be debilitating for many mothers and their loved ones. Addressing these worries will improve the mental health among adults within the region, which is an essential element of health and well-being. Additionally, to a lesser extent SDG Number 5: Gender Equality comes into play here. The issue of maternal mortality directly impacts those assigned female at birth, so a poorer health outcome for females than males would cause women and men to experience human development at disproportionate levels. (2, 9, 11)

**Human Development Process**

High rates of maternal mortality can be a result of many different societal elements. Maps and charts released by the World Health Organization identified that the areas with higher rates of maternal mortality are concentrated in Africa and a bit in South America and South Asia, though those numbers are not nearly as shockingly high as the ones in Sub-Saharan Africa specifically, with South Sudan, Chad, and Sierra Leone presenting over 1,100 deaths per 100,000 live births. Though Sierra Leone has halved its mortality rate since the year 2000, the rate of decrease has slowed to a plateau in all three of these countries. The areas most affected by maternal mortality all show major similarities: weak institutions, extreme poverty, and often corrupt regimes. Poverty is the most likely contributor to poor maternal outcomes. In order to build strong healthcare systems, a lot of money is required from the government. This likely explains why institutions are overall inadequate, even though at times they are still present. Maps of healthcare facilities in Sub-Saharan Africa show that there are healthcare facilities in these countries, but in Chad and South Sudan, there are very few, and they are very far away from each other. Sierra Leone, on the other hand, has had a great amount of involvement from charities like Partners in Health in recent years helping to improve the healthcare system. However, though there are many non-hospital facilities, the number of hospitals is very limited, and the conditions at these facilities can often be less than ideal, and the cost of care could still discourage impoverished mothers from seeking out medical assistance when it is needed. (4, 8, 2)	

The issue of maternal mortality is both complex and adaptive. It is complex, because though income is generally a trend with places where mortality is low, it can seem like the right steps are being taken towards solving the issue with no avail. Though Sierra Leone appears to have the proper facilities, mothers still have over a 1 in 100 chance of not surviving the birth of their child. It is adaptive because the rate has been changing over time, and some countries have been showing much better improvement than others. It is not an emerging problem, fortunately, because the global maternal mortality rate has decreased significantly in the past twenty years. However, as the problem has gained more attention, intergovernmental organizations should be acting in the most affected countries to bring the numbers down and bring peace of mind for parents in these areas. This is an issue that should be tackled on the global scale, though it only strongly affects a few specific regions: Sub-Saharan Africa and a bit of South Asia, namely Afghanistan. (8, 4)

**Geospatial Data Science Methods**

The best geospatial data science methods for this issue involve mapping. Since the maternal mortality rates are evaluated on a country by country basis, the best way to make the numbers easiest to understand and to reveal the most trends is by projecting data on a map. Though a few target countries can be drawn from the data, the plateau of improvement indicates that perhaps the solution is to look deeper than the country level. Population data combined with a machine learning model that can predict where women of childbearing age are likely to be located in any given country at any given year will allow intergovernmental organizations like the United Nations or charity organizations like Partners in Health to identify specific areas that are lacking a maternal healthcare facility within a reasonable distance. By understanding information on these women like income, grant money from charities could be directed to regions where the most maternal deaths are possible because of inability to afford emergency maternal care. By combining this information with a newly calculated maternal mortality rate for each year and general surveys of mothers on the quality of care they received, officials can better understand how the aid methods that were implemented are actually helping with development and if an improvement in the mortality rate can be expected any time soon. 

**Discussion**

This research process has been arduous to say the least. Many studies have been conducted on maternal mortality, but generally they aim to identify information for a select few countries or have moved their focus away from maternal mortality in general towards neonatal or child under five mortality, or maternal mortality as a result of a disease like Ebola or HIV/AIDS. I believe that an all-encompassing research plan that targets the most dire countries but hopefully extends to fully map all of Sub-Saharan Africa will be the best solution to this problem. A detailed mapping of how well the healthcare facilities match up with the location of expectant mothers and an overall sense of how well these facilities are actually doing their jobs is noticeably absent in the research that I have encountered. My research exists to build upon prior studies to create a more comprehensive story of maternal outcomes in Sub-Saharan Africa through maps, a presentation method that is accessible to many. Compiling this information is the first step along the road towards allowing this issue to enter into the public eye to gain the assistance of wealthier and more established countries in promoting a safer and healthier motherhood for the places that need it the most.
